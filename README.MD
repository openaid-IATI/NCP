Narrowcasting Prototype
============

The Narrowcasting prototype enables the creation of presentations out of 2 data sources:
-[IATI data](https://www.iatistandard.org) through the [OIPA API](http://www.oipa.nl)
-[RSR data](http://rsr.akvo.org) through the [RSR API](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/wiki)

The end result is an animated presentation with a public URL that can be shared and shown on displays.

For a quick overview of functionality a [how-to video is available](https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/Narrowcasting-application/blob/master/narrowcasting_server/static/videos/NCP_tutorial.mp4).

The narrowcasting prototype is licensed under the GNU AGPL license.

Narrowcasting is developed by team Zimmerman & Zimmerman in Amsterdam.
